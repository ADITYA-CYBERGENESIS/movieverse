Avoid using this color on lighter backgrounds to maintain readability.
2. Background Color: #100202
This deep, dark color is perfect for the primary background of your website.
Apply it to large sections like the body, header, and footer to create a cohesive and modern look.
Use it to make bright colors (like primary, secondary, and accent) pop.
3. Primary Color: #ff6666
Use this color for call-to-action (CTA) buttons, such as "Subscribe," "Play," or "Watch Now."
Apply it to links, icons, or interactive elements to grab attention.
You can also use it sparingly in the navigation menu or as an accent color for hover effects.
4. Secondary Color: #caa52b
Use this warm, golden tone for decorative elements or to highlight secondary information, such as subheadings, labels, or secondary buttons.
Apply it to borders, dividers, or icons for added elegance.
Incorporate it subtly in navigation or footer elements for consistency.
5. Accent Color: #77eb2f
Use this vibrant green sparingly as an accent color to emphasize specific actions or statuses.
Apply it to success messages, notifications, progress bars, or badges for a fresh and energetic feel.
